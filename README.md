# Valedictorian-speech-2025

Hi everyone! Tze Kean here, I would first like to thank everyone for your support. I could not have done it without you, and as I thought about what is the best way to represent all of us, our voice as the class of 2025 collectively, I thought, why not have everyone contribute to the script! Something that we can all remember before we graduate from NTU, before we enter into a new phase of our lives.

As CCDS graduates, let's show the world that we can use github as a tool üòé.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Attention

I am thinking of having a CCDS graduation party for all of us to come together to celebrate! I've never organised such a large scale party/get together. If this is something that you are keen on, you can indicate your interest in this [google form](https://forms.gle/TEqxaj4LR5ggnxKo6), I would greatly appreciate if you would also be willing to help organise!

## Rules

1. Please do not use offensive language or hate messages
2. Let's all be courteous when raising a github issue, please use it professionally

## Usage

This repo is made so that we can all voice our thoughts and for you to include what you hope to hear during convocation! To contribute, there are a few ways!

1. Crack open a github issue
2. Open a PR with a markdown file of what you want to voice out
3. Send in your thoughts through this [form](https://forms.gle/d8AJbTWHipGAdtEE8)

## Raising github issue

There are 2 types of github issue that you can raise. An `Idea` or `Discussion` issue. If you would like something to be included that is currently not in the speech, please raise it as an `idea` so that I can have a look at it. If there is something that you are not comfortable with having in the speech you can raise it as a `Discussion` issue. While I hope to collectively represent everyone, I might not be able to do so, but I will still try to accomodate as many request as possible!

For `idea`, you can add pictures if you would like, I am thinking of making a photo album or to use slides during the speech if possible (nothing confirmed yet)!

## Open PR

If there is something that you rather type out, say a paragraph or a chunk of text, a quote that you want to be spoken, you can raise a PR. Please PR a `markdown` file, labeled as `<name>_<tag>.md`. Where name is your name and tag being in `[idea,discussion]`.

Please use a unique name so that I do not have to resolve git conflicts üò¢.
